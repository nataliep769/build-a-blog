    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>I am a writer, editor and critic specializing in the arts. In 2014 I graduated from Indiana University with a degree in English literature. I completed a master’s degree at Syracuse University’s Goldring Arts Journalism program, a division of the college’s renowned S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. I have published reviews and feature pieces with Fanfare Magazine, Charleston’s Post and Courier, Central New York’s Café Momus and Syracuse New Times. I have also written content for the Bravo! Vail Music Festival and the Denver Philharmonic Orchestra.</p>

        <p>During one whirlwind summer in 1788, Mozart started and completed what would become three of his most popular symphonies. His Symphony No. 40 is the second of those three. Thought to have been an inspiration for Beethoven’s Fifth, it’s one of only two symphonies Mozart composed in a minor key.</p>

        <p>Known for his unusually large hands, Rachmaninoff could reach a remarkably wide interval of a 12th on the piano keyboard between his thumb and pinky finger—most people can barely reach an octave!</p>
